## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Okie-dokie, this took me far more time than I expected. What I learned? That I might always end-up cycled in my own code and get lost.

I have a feeling like this might be the worst I've written so far. After two days I've almost gave up and I think I rather hard-coded this challenge instead of some responsivness.

### Continued development

I need to get more into flexbox and become more confident about it. So I don't end up with tries and fails so often.

Also I need to better understand connections between positioning and whats actually possible with it, together with using relative units and their case of use.

### Useful resources

- [A modern CSS Reset](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-modern-css-reset/) - I heard about CSS Reset templates during my online course.. There is a lot of options out there, but I've decided to start with this one.
